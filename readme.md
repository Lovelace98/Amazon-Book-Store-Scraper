**This project uses selenium to scrape amazon kindle book store. **

## PROBLEM
A client was a heavy reader and enjoys fiction and great books. The one place to find great books is to visit the amazon kindle best sellers book section. He reached out to me for a web scraper to scrape the entire book section into a file he could use on excel. 

## SOLUTION

I used selenium and the pandas library to scrape the entire best sellers section and then saved the needed data into a csv file that my client could easily use in excel.
